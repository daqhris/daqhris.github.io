		<h1>about me</h1><br>
                    <p><small><i>Hey, I'm really glad to "meet" you.<br> 
                    It seems like you are eager to know where your fingertips have landed you... 
			    </i></small></p>
                    <hr><br>
                    <div align=left>
                    <b>Chris A. Iradukunda</b> was born in November 1992 in Bujumbura, BURUNDI.<br> 
                    He attended primary school at Ecole Primaire Stella Matutina and high school at Lycée du Saint-Esprit de Bujumbura with an emphasis on Maths and Physics.<br>
                    At 20 years old, he began studying Chinese Language and taking college preparatory lessons at Tianjin University (China).<br>
		    In 2013, he enrolled in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Science and Technology, Beijing as a scholarship-sponsored undergrad.<br>
                    As of 2017, he was pursuing his passion in the CS field at University of Namur, Belgium.</div><br>
                    
                    <div align=left>
			Besides being a studious and hard-working individual, <b>Chris-Armel</b> often strives to land a useful hand to his community and brings to fruition diverse side projects.<br>
                    During primary school, he was involved in the Scout movement as part of the Charles de Foucauld Unit, situated across a town river (Muha river) at the edge of his home district (Kinanira II area).<br>    
                    Then, at the Jesuits' prestigious high school, he participated in different on-campus student clubs which led to him leading the 'Akanuma Journal' student club as editor-in-chief and geeking late at night in the computer lab.<br> 
                    After graduation(2011), he received the Best Devotion to School Award and later, was granted a full scholarship to a Chinese university.<br>
			</div><br>
			
                    <div align=left>
                    Over a year and half period, he was learning from scratch the Chinese language and touring the North-Eastern region of the Middle Kingdom during school vacation to soak up its vast culture and history.<br>
                    Starting from 2013, he attended university in Beijing and embarked on a 4-years major in Computer Science.<br> 
                    Out of the classroom, he would usually hang around the Zhongguancun 'tech hive' area and take part into hackathons or discussions delving into topics of FinTech and AI.<br>
                    Concurrently, he kept his traveler hat on and then, by sheer luck, landed gigs as a movie 'extra' actor and as a foreign actors recruiter for major Chinese blockbusters(2015-2016).
			</div><br>
			
                    <div align=left>
                    He speaks fluently his mother-tongue Kirundi, French, English and Chinese. He can also maintain light conversations in Swahili, Arabic and Dutch.<br>
                    <b>Chris</b> is very much into reading books, photography(black-and-white formats), outdoor activities(biking, swimming), coding in Javascript/Python and current research in Artificial Intelligence.<br>
                    Sometimes, he may get opinionated on political issues. Oups!</div><br>
			
                    <div align=left>
                    Recently, you might have met him either in Egypt or Belgium.<br> 
                    Anyway, whoever you are, he is open to having a cup of tea/coffee, collaborate, make on-the-spot funny comedy sketchs or improvise dance moves with you.<br>
              	    Take care!
