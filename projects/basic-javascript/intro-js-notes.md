1. Declare JavaScript Variables
JavaScript has 8 data types: 
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- symbol
- bigint
- number
- object

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data.
Declare a variable by using the word **var**. 
End statements with *semicolons*.

2. Sotring values with the Assignment Operator
Store a value in a variable with the *assignment* operator **=**.
Caculations are firstly performed on the right side of **=** before the value is assigned to the left side.

3. Assigning the value of one variable to another
The value of one variable can be assigned to another variable by using the assignment operator.

4. Initializing variables with the asssignment operator
It's totally right to attribute value to a variable in the same line that it is declared. 

5. Understanding uninitialized variables
New variables have an initial value of **undefined**.

6. Understanding case sensitivity in variables
All variables and function names are case sensitive.
Capitalization is important.
Multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. Same as in : *camelCase*.

7. Add two numbers with JavaScript
*Number* is a data type that represents numeric data.
Use **+** as a symbol for an addition operator when placed between two numbers. 

8. Substract one number from another 
Use **-** as symbol for substraction.

9. Multiply two numbers
Use __*__ for multiplication of 2 numbers. 

10. Divide one number by another
Use __/__ for division.

11. Increment a number
Use __++__ to *increment* or add 1 to a variable.
    i++; equals i=i+1;

12. Decrement a number
Decrease a variable by 1 with **--**.

13. Create decimal numbers
Decimal numbers can also be called *floating point* or *floats* and be stored in variables as value. 

14. Multiply two decimals
Decimal numebrs can be multiplied like the whole numbers.

15. Divide one decimal by another

16. Finding a remainder
__%__ is the remainder operator that gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
Remainder division by 2 will determine if a number is Odd or Even.

17. Compound assignment with augmented addition
The __+=__ operator is used to add by addition and assign directly a value to a variable.

18. Compound assignment with augmented substraction
__-=__ substracts a number from a variable.

19. Compound assignment with augmented multiplication
__*=__ multiplies a variable by a number.
 
20. Compound assignment with augmented division
__/=__ divides a variable by another number.

21. Declaring string variables
