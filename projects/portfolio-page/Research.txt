  Hello, I am **Clark Simon**.
  I love to travel and take *lots of* photos.
  ___
  Once a month, I climb a *very* tall mountain. On a *different* continent.
  My journey started from **September 2015**. My first peak was **Machu Pichu**.
  ___
  Here is what **President Barack Obama** _might have_ said about me:
  >The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.
