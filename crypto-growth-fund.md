### What is the meaning of *crypto*?  
> A **cryptocurrency** (or *crypto*) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange 
> wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, 
> to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.    
> **Cryptocurrency** does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

### What do you mean by *crypto growth fund*? 
A **crypto growth fund** is a fully digitized version of a growth fund that is dedicated to investing and trading cryptos and tokens on public blockchains.  

It is an online-native investment portfolio that: 
- has operations uniquely in the cyberspace,
- openly shares transactions records and holdings,  
- is independent from any centralized entity like a regulatory body, a local authority or a government agency. 

This fund owns and manages digital assets that are:
- accessible on the Internet by using a computer,  
- known for practical implementations and widespread adoption,  
- on-track for an increase in value overtime,  
- available only in electronic form,     
- held onto over a long-term horizon (minimum of 10 years).

## Founding Story  
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

The inability to settle and remain steadily in a physical location 
has taught me recently that any physical asset may be seized, stolen, 
damaged or devalued by an individual, 
a group of persons or a larger entity like a government.

Since the summer of 2015 until now, 
I live more or less with few personal belongings.
I have experienced events that forced me to stay on the move 
due to safety, poverty or weather reasons.

At least once a year, an event has occured that led me to losing access 
to banking services or university facilities or health care systems.
I have given up on owning large or heavy items after life-altering experiences 
as in detention centers, refugee camps, homelessness, seasonal lodging, 
couchsurfing and lately as an undocumented immigrant.

After repeatedly going through the loss of personal properties, reputation, 
material possessions, human connections and at the end, 
stumbling into a slow but steady recovery, 
I have only been able to regain few valuable assets.
Chief among them are some digital assets, 
namely Bitcoin and Ether purchased in Autumn 2017.
I managed to recover the BTC holdings in Summer 2019 and ETH in Summer 2021.
How? Well, by regaining access to digital wallet backups!

Although, I was not actively managing the crypto wallets, 
they remained intact and had gained much value afterwards.
For a long time, I thought of them as lost property. 
But later on, after the recovery of their secrets keys, 
I understood the high-value of global decentralized blockchains 
and the related digital currencies.

Thus, I decided to entirely play the long game 
and set up a personal crypto growth fund 
with the intent of holding long-term investments in digital assets.
In case I earn or receive more paper money than the amount 
that is necessary for basic needs (i.e: food, transport, accomodation), 
then I will purchase some cryptocurrencies and add them to 
the self-custodial wallets of the fund.

## Goals  
### Inception  
- [Shawn Carter](https://twitter.com/sc) (aka JAY-Z) was one of the first influencer after hearing his song: [*The Story of OJ*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0). 
- Another inspiration is the motto [*"software is eating the world"*](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) coined by the venture capitalist [Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/).  

### Main Targets 
1. Foster [decentralized digital assets and protocols](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) on the the Web3 Internet.  
2. Guarantee [financial independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) to the fund's founder. 
3. Seek [capital appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp) of assets under management.
