## Definitions 
Hello! Let's start off by getting a common understanding of what is this fund.   
You will find, below, detailed explanations for: `growth fund`, `crypto`, and `crypto growth fund`.  

### Growth fund  
> A **growth fund** is a diversified portfolio of stocks that has capital appreciation as its primary goal, 
> with little or no dividend payouts. Most of them offer higher potential capital appreciation but usually at above-average risk.

### Crypto-asset  
> A **crypto-asset** is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger
> existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, 
> to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.    
> It does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

### Cryptoassets growth fund 
This is a growth fund dedicated to long-term investments in crypto markets and other assets on public blockchains.  

In other words, it is an online investment portfolio that: 
- has operations uniquely in cyberspace,

- is independent of any institution or centralized entity. 

More precisely, this fund holds and manages digital assets that are:
- accessible on the Internet by using a computing device,  
- known for practical implementations and widespread adoption,  
- on track for an increase in value over a long-term time horizon (more than 5 years).

## Founding Story  
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

The inability to settle and remain steadily in a physical location 
has taught me recently that any physical asset may be seized, stolen, 
damaged or devalued by an individual, 
a group of persons or a larger entity like a government.

Since the summer of 2015 until now, 
I live more or less with few personal belongings.
I have experienced events that forced me to stay on the move 
due to safety, poverty, or weather reasons.

At least once a year, an event has occurred that led me to lose access 
to banking services or university facilities, or health care systems.
I have given up on owning large or heavy items after life-altering experiences
in detention centers, refugee camps, homelessness, seasonal lodging,
couch-surfing, and lately as an undocumented immigrant.

After repeatedly going through the loss of personal properties, reputation, 
material possessions, human connections, and at the end, 
stumbling into a slow but steady recovery, 
I have only been able to regain a few valuable assets.
Chief among them are some digital assets, 
namely Bitcoin and Ether purchased in the Autumn of 2017.
I managed to recover the BTC holdings in the Summer of 2019 and ETH in the Summer of 2021.
How? Well, by regaining access to digital wallet backups!

Although I was not actively managing the crypto wallets, 
they remained intact and gained much value afterward.
For a long time, I thought of them as lost property. 
But later on, after the recovery of their secret keys, 
I understood the high value of global decentralized blockchains 
and the related digital currencies.

Thus, I decided to entirely play the long game 
and set up a personal crypto growth fund 
with the intent of holding long-term investments in digital assets.
In case I earn or receive more paper money than the amount 
that is necessary for basic needs (i.e: food, transport, accommodation), 
then I will purchase some cryptocurrencies and add them to 
the self-custodial wallets of the fund.

## Goals  
### Inception  
- [Shawn Carter](https://twitter.com/sc) (JAY-Z) was an initial source of inspiration after understanding his song: [*The Story of OJ*](https://genius.com/Jay-z-the-story-of-oj-lyrics).  
- Another spark of inspiration came from the motto [*"software is eating the world"*](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) coined by the tech founder and investor [Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/).  

### Targets 
1. Foster [decentralized digital assets and protocols](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) accessible over the Internet.  
2. Guarantee [financial independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) to the portfolio manager/owner. 
3. Seek long-term [capital appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp) of crypto assets.  

## Transparency
### Disclosures 
- All transactions from this fund's wallets are recorded on public, decentralized, permissionless, and open-source blockchains.  
- High volatility in crypto markets should be expected and always accounted for when estimating the value of assets under management.  

### Sources of Investment  
Income from underpaid manual labor that may be done with human body parts but without life insurance, work contract, or legal rights.  
Otherwise, the invested capital might originate from monetary gifts or cryptocurrency airdrops.  

### Disclaimers  
- Nothing published on this website constitutes investment, accounting, or legal advice.  
- This fund and its manager do not recommend that you purchase, sell, or hold any digital token or other crypto assets.  
- There is no intent to influence anyone in order to pursue a particular investment style or strategy.
