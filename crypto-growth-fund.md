### What do you mean by *crypto growth fund*? 
A **crypto growth fund** is a fully digitized version of a growth fund which is exclusively dedicated to investing and trading cryptocurrencies 
based on digital public ledgers (such as a blockchain).

## Founding Story  
The inability to settle and remain steadily in a physical location (due to many reasons) has taught me recently that 
any physical asset may be seized, stolen, damaged or devalued by an individual, a group of persons or a larger entity like a government.  

Since the summer of 2015 until now, I live more or less with few personal belongings. 
I have experienced events that forced me to stay on the move due to safety, poverty or weather reasons.

At least once a year, an event has occured that led me to losing access to banking services or university facilities or health care systems. 
I have given up on owning large or heavy items after life-altering experiences in an illegal detention center, refugee camps, homelessness, seasonal lodging/couchsurfing and lately as an undocumented immigrant. 

After repeatedly going through loss of personal properties, reputation, material possessions, human connections and at the end, stumble into slow but steady recovery, I have only been able to regain few valuable assets. 
Chief among them are some digital assets, namely Bitcoin and Etherieum purchased in Autumn 2017. 
I managed to recover the BTC holdings in Summer 2019 and ETH in Summer 2021. 
How? Well, by regaining access to digital backups.  

Although, I was not actively managing the crypto wallets, they remained intact and had gained much value afterwards. 
For a long time, I thought of them as lost property. But later on after recovery of their secrets keys, I understood the high-value of global decentralized blockchains and related digital currencies. 
All of this, recently drew a big smile on my face and sent to my body a wave of excitment coupled with hope. 

Thus, I decided to entirely play the long game and set up a personal crypto growth fund with the intent of holding long-term investments in digital assets. 
In case I earn or receive more paper money than the amount that is necessary for basic needs (i.e: food, transport, accomodation), then I will purchase some cryptocurrencies and add them to the self-custodial wallets of the fund.
