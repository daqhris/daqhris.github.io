### What do you mean by *crypto growth fund*? 
A **crypto growth fund** is a fully digitized version of a growth fund which is exclusively dedicated to investing and trading cryptocurrencies 
based on digital public ledgers (such as a blockchain).  

It is an online-native investment portfolio that has operations uniquely in the cyberspace, openly shares transactions records and holdings 
and is also not formally registered with any regulatory body, local authority or government agency. 

This type of fund owns and manages digital assets that are:
- easily accessible by using the Internet  
- known for practical & technical implementations  
- on-track for fast growth over a long-term horizon (5 - 10 years) 
- not redeemable or convertible into physical assets afterwards

## Founding Story  
The inability to settle and remain steadily in a physical location (due to many reasons) has taught me recently that 
any physical asset may be seized, stolen, damaged or devalued by an individual, a group of persons or a larger entity like a government.  

Since the summer of 2015 until now, I live more or less with few personal belongings. 
I have experienced events that forced me to stay on the move due to safety, poverty or weather reasons.

At least once a year, an event has occured that led me to losing access to banking services or university facilities or health care systems. 
I have given up on owning large or heavy items after life-altering experiences in an illegal detention center, refugee camps, homelessness, seasonal lodging/couchsurfing and lately as an undocumented immigrant. 

After repeatedly going through loss of personal properties, reputation, material possessions, human connections and at the end, stumble into slow but steady recovery, I have only been able to regain few valuable assets. 
Chief among them are some digital assets, namely Bitcoin and Ether purchased in Autumn 2017. 
I managed to recover the BTC holdings in Summer 2019 and ETH in Summer 2021. 
How? Well, by regaining access to digital backups!  

Although, I was not actively managing the crypto wallets, they remained intact and had gained much value afterwards. 
For a long time, I thought of them as lost property. But later on, after recovery of their secrets keys, I understood the high-value of global decentralized blockchains and the related digital currencies. 
All of this recently drew a big smile on my face and sent all over my body a wave of excitment coupled with hope. 

Thus, I decided to entirely play the long game and set up a personal crypto growth fund with the intent of holding long-term investments in digital assets. 
In case I earn or receive more paper money than the amount that is necessary for basic needs (i.e: food, transport, accomodation), then I will purchase some cryptocurrencies and add them to the self-custodial wallets of the fund.

## Goals  
[Shawn Carter](https://twitter.com/sc) (aka JAY-Z) said it in the best possible way on one of his hit song: [*The Story of O.J.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0).   

**Main Targets**: 
1. Foster decentralized digital assets, protocols and platforms.  
2. Guarantee future [financial independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence).   
3. Seek personal [capital appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp).
