## Introduction 

### What is a *growth fund*?  
> A growth fund is a diversified portfolio of stocks that has capital appreciation as its primary goal, 
> with little or no dividend payouts. 
> The portfolio mainly consists of companies with above-average growth that 
> reinvest their earnings into expansion, acquisitions, and/or research and development (R&D). 
> Most growth funds offer higher potential capital appreciation but usually at above-average risk.

### What is the meaning of *crypto*?  
> A cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange 
> wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, 
> to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. 
> Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

### What do you mean by *crypto growth fund*? 
A **crypto growth fund** is a fully digitized version of a growth fund which is exclusively dedicated to investing and trading cryptocurrencies 
based on digital public ledgers (such as a blockchain).  

It is an online-native investment portfolio that has operations uniquely in the cyberspace, openly shares transactions records and holdings 
and is also independent from any centralized entity like a regulatory body, a local authority or a government agency. 

This type of fund owns and manages digital assets that are:
- easily accessible by using the Internet  
- known for practical & technical implementations  
- on-track for fast growth over a long-term time horizon (10 - 20 years) 
- not redeemable or convertible into physical assets afterwards

## Founding Story  
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

The inability to settle and remain steadily in a physical location (due to many reasons) has taught me recently that any physical asset may be seized, stolen, damaged or devalued by an individual, a group of persons or a larger entity like a government.

Since the summer of 2015 until now, I live more or less with few personal belongings.
I have experienced events that forced me to stay on the move due to safety, poverty or weather reasons.

At least once a year, an event has occured that led me to losing access to banking services or university facilities or health care systems.
I have given up on owning large or heavy items after life-altering experiences as in detention centers, refugee camps, homelessness, seasonal lodging/couchsurfing and lately as an undocumented immigrant.

After repeatedly going through the loss of personal properties, reputation, material possessions, human connections and at the end, stumbling into a slow but steady recovery, I have only been able to regain few valuable assets.
Chief among them are some digital assets, namely Bitcoin and Ether purchased in Autumn 2017.
I managed to recover the BTC holdings in Summer 2019 and ETH in Summer 2021.
How? Well, by regaining access to digital wallet backups!

Although, I was not actively managing the crypto wallets, they remained intact and had gained much value afterwards.
For a long time, I thought of them as lost property. But later on, after the recovery of their secrets keys, I understood the high-value of global decentralized blockchains and the related digital currencies.

Thus, I decided to entirely play the long game and set up a personal crypto growth fund with the intent of holding long-term investments in digital assets.
In case I earn or receive more paper money than the amount that is necessary for basic needs (i.e: food, transport, accomodation), then I will purchase some cryptocurrencies and add them to the self-custodial wallets of the fund.

## Goals  
[Shawn Carter](https://twitter.com/sc) (aka JAY-Z) said it in the best possible way on one of his hit song: [*The Story of O.J.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0) which aligns well with the fund's perspective.  
Another great influence is the venture capital firm [Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)](https://a16z.com/about/) that coined the motto [*Software is eating the world*](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/).  

**Main Targets**: 
1. Foster [decentralized digital assets, protocols and platforms](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835).  
2. Guarantee [financial independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence).   
3. Seek [capital appreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp).
