  <p><i>Hello</i>, I'm very glad that you have discovered <b>A WALK≡A DAY</b><i>!</i>
</p>

<p><strong>INTRO</strong>
<br>Born out of simple boredom and burst of creativity, <b>A WALK≡A DAY</b> is a <i>black and white visual arts project</i>.
<br>Since then, every long walk ends with a collection of B&W photos snapped on-the-go by using a smartphone camera.
</p>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong> ?
<br>The first image was published on Instagram (<i>@all.day.walking</i>) on <i>July 19th, 2017</i>.
<br>At least one picture is (or should be) posted on a daily basis.
<br>This art project's lifespan is <i>5 years</i>.</p>

<p><strong>WHY</strong> ?
<br>A single motivating quote essentially inspired the creation of the project : <i>"The Sun is up and running, everyday, for you."</i>
<br>In a global trend of fast-paced urbanization, generations of kids are growing without a sense of <i>curiosity</i> about their surroundings and <i>adventurous drive</i> in unfamiliar landscapes.
<br><i>Instagram</i>, with 400 million daily active users, was selected as the most compelling online platform to host such a <i>street photography gallery</i> that would target millenials and inspire them to <i>creatively</i> lead a healthy lifestyle. 
</p>

<p><strong>HOW</strong> ?
<br>Images are shared on <i>Instagram</i> in a black and white format with a wide white frame.
<br>All pictures are taken from an <i>Android phone</i> and later, edited in <i>Snapseed</i>.
<br>The hashtag <i>#awalkaday</i> is attached to every post and can be clicked on to discover similar posts shared by the Instagram community.
</p>
<p><strong>WHERE</strong> ?
<br>Photos are taken at any time of the day from the streets and hidden alleys of <i>Western Europe</i>.
<br>I'm currently based in <i>Belgium</i>.
</p>

<p><strong>WHO</strong> ?
<br>The person behind the #awalkaday art project is <a href="https://daqhris.me/"><i>Chris-Armel</i></a> (@daqhris).
<br>He was born in <i>Burundi</i> and has previously traveled to Eastern Asia, Middle East and North Africa.
